Cut the Bread aims to help a user by logging & notifying the user about his collection progression!

Pages:
- First page  : Craft list - Displays list of objective receipes & their state (ready or in-progress)
- Second page : Components list - Displays list of components needed to craft a receipe & their ammount / requirements ammount

The user can switch from craft list to component list via a navigation menu on the left (by swipign to the right or clicking the burger menu icon)

The user can rise or lower a component ammount by clicking the + or - icon : when the component ammount goes over the requirement (or equal), the red cross changes to a green checkmark to inform the user the component ammount is reached

When all components of a receipe are ready, the receipe changes state to ready aswell

When a receipe is ready, the red cross changes to a green checkmark, and a phone notification (or vibration) is fired
